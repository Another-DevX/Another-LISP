# LISP Interpreter in C and Rust

This project is an implementation of a LISP interpreter, inspired by Daniel Holden's book ["Build Your Own Lisp"](https://buildyourownlisp.com/). The goal is to explore how the same programming concepts can be applied across different programming languages, specifically C and Rust.
